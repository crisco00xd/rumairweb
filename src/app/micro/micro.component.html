<p> <strong>MICRO CLASS</strong> <br/>
    This category is aimed at designing for the highest lifting efficiency, parameterized
    by the “payload fraction”. Also, the mission requirements and scoring formula prioritize 
    highly deployable and user-friendly designs inspired by Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
    (M-UAV) applications.
