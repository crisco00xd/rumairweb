    <strong>ADVANCED CLASS</strong> <br />
    
    The theme for this redesigned category is Mars exploration.
    The goal is to design an aircraft that can successfully deliver colonists, habitats 
    and water supply drops to the Planet's surface. The competition demands efficiency in every
    aspect, as our score is directly tied to the amount of supplies and colonists we can deliver 
    while adhering to the constraints on weight and dimensions imposed by the rules.
